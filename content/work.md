### Root Leaf Flower Fruit

"I was completely absorbed by this story song of a grandson and grandmother trying to connect both to the world around them and to their sense of self." —Tina Makereti, author of *The Imaginary Lives of James Pōneke* and *Where the Rēkohu Bone Sings*.

"This book kept surprising me. I loved its fascination with the body's sleights of hand, and the attention it paid to childhood, memory and other buried things." —Anna Smaill, author of *The Chimes* and *Bird Life*.
